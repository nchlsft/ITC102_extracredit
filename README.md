The petition that I decided to sign was a petition to federally recognize the Chinook Indian Nation as a tribe in the United States. As a recognized tribe they would be able to have access to more benifits such as free dental and healthcare. They would also have more access to educational opportunites and more rights over their land. Their community would benifit a lot from this.
